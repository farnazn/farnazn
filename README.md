## Hello <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25">

I am Farnaz! This is how you pronounce my name: `[f√¶rÀàn…ëÀêz]` - and since not everyone knows what to do with [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet), [here's a YouTube video saying it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnW72cD-Fo8).

I am an environmental data scientist with over a decade of experience in private, consulting, and government sectors.
